    <h2>Understanding the Orrery</h2>
    <p>
        The Orrery serves as the core of our application, functioning as the primary entry point 
        for visualizing the motions of the planets in our solar system. It inherits from the 
        JavaFX Application class, which allows for a rich graphical user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>start</strong> method is called during the graphical initialization process. 
        This method sets up the main Stage object and builds the application layout through the 
        <strong>buildLayout</strong> method. The Orrery object manages the window's contents, 
        encapsulating both the Space and Info classes, which represent the moving planets and 
        the information panel, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, the Orrery class directly managed the Planet class. However, as the interface 
        evolved, the responsibilities became blurred. Consequently, the planets were separated 
        into the Space class, focusing solely on their animation, while the Info class handles 
        the display of planetary data. This separation allows for a clearer structure and better 
        management of the application's components.

    <h2>What is an Orrery?</h2>
    <p>
        An orrery is an apparatus that demonstrates the relative positions and motions of 
        celestial bodies in the solar system, typically represented by balls that are moved 
        by a clockwork mechanism. In our digital version, these movements are simulated to 
        provide an interactive experience for users, allowing them to explore the dynamics 
        of planetary motion in an engaging way.
